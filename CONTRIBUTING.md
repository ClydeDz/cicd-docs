## CI/CD Docs uses GitHub
CI/CD Docs uses GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. CI/CD Docs' website is also hosted via GitHub Pages. 

#### Pull requests 
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Your pull requests are most welcome:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

For a detailed guide on, read more about [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

#### Branches
And while we're talking about PR's, here is a little description about the branches in this repo.
* **`master` branch**   
The single-source-of-truth for branching off any code from. Once you're happy with your changes, you would create a PR to merge back to `master`.
* **`gh-pages` branch**    
This branch is where the website is hosted off (i.e. via GitHub Pages). Once a stable code-base is achieved in master (with features/bug-fixes/etc, of course), I will create a PR to merge the changes to `gh-pages`. *Please do not create a PR to this branch directly - it will be declined.*
* **`development` or any other branches**    
In this repository, any other branches would have been created for development / testing purpose. Branching off these branches is not recommended.
