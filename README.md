## What is CI/CD Docs?   
How does one document the Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS) pipeline one just created? With CI/CD Docs - now you can! Documenting your Azure DevOps pipeline was never easier - export, upload and go. Just upload your build and/or release definition file (which is a JSON file) and see the magic happen.
