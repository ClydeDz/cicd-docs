# CI/CD Docs   
Document your Azure DevOps pipeline.

## What is CI/CD Docs?   
How to document my VSTS or Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline? With CI/CD Docs - now you can! Documenting your Azure pipeline was never easier - export, upload and go. Just upload your build and/or release definition file (of .json format) (yes, you can export your build and release definitions as a JSON file from Azure DevOps) and see the magic happen.
